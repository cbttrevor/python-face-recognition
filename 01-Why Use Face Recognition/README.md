## Learning Objective

Facial recognition is a useful feature with a variety of practical use cases.
For example, imagine that you are building a photo library, and want to sort and search through photos based on who's present in them.
What if you have security cameras at your home, and want to determine if a person's face is or isn't in the scene, in real-time?

Python is an excellent programming language for performing all types of machine learning tasks, including facial recognition.
There's an open source community module called `face-recognition` that sits on top of the dlib library.
Dlib has been around since 2002 and is authored by Davis E. King.

In this CBT Nuggets skill, we'll be exploring how to make use of the Python `face-recognition` module to find and compare faces in still images.
