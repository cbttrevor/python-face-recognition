## Facial Recognition with Python

This [CBT Nuggets training]() focuses on using facial recognition in Python.
First of all, you'll learn how to set up your development environment for facial recognition projects.
Next, you'll learn how to detect faces in image files.
After simple face detection, you'll learn how to compare faces to a "known" person, to determine if that person exists in a photo.
We'll finish up by taking a look at how to build Python REST API, using the Flask module, to wrap some facial recognition capabilities.
